# PDFCombiner
Srikanth Sugavanam, 26th January 2024.

TL;DR - This is a Python script generated using the help of ChatGPT 3.0 to combine a set of PDF files into one. No need to use dodgy online websites. :)

## How to use it

1. Put all the PDF files you want to combine into a single folder.
2. Currently the code combines the files in an alphabetic order. Name the files accordingly.
3. Enter the code, add the source folder path and the destination folder path appended with file name ('Test.pdf')
4. Run.

Works like a charm for me. 

## Dependencies
You will need the PyPDF2 package. You can install it using pip. 

## Disclaimer 
I have not fully tested the code. I am just giving this as is, as it worked for me, and I hope it will help you too. Use it at your own calculated risk.
